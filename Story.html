        She's the reason I am still breathing. Since past few years was in a hell lot of emotional pain/trauma. Maybe that's why God sent this cute little angel into my life, who gave me a new reason to live life without expectations, to love without boundary, and helped me healing.
                     12th Mar'18 when she entered our life and everything changed. She was just like a soft snowball who filled our life with endless love and happiness. It is rightly said that " this world would have been a beautiful place if everyone had the ability to love as unconditionally as a dog. She's the reason behind being the "Voice Of The Voiceless".
